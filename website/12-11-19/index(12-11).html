		Hi, my name is Ben Yakura and you’ve found my personal website. I don’t know why you were looking for it, but this is where I’m putting stuff about me: my hopes and dreams, ideas, artsy things, random thoughts, shoe size (8½ if you’re curious), and whatever else I can think of. 

	So who am I? ...who am I? Damn that’s a really hard question. How about “What am I” instead?

	I am a programmer. I am a philosopher. I am a UI designer. All ‘in training’, but really what do you expect. I’m 25 and haven’t gotten a job doing any of that yet; all my experience is from school, side gigs, or personal projects like this. I think I’m doing alright though, but you tell me.

	I grew up in Colorado Springs, the city that thinks it’s still a town. For extracurriculars I did gymnastics (at a competitive level even), robotics, and a handful of other things; mostly science related. 

	I went to collage up in Boulder for Computer Science, fell in love with philosophy, majored in one, minored in the other; graduated without getting any kind of internship or work experience, like an idiot, and now I’m trying to work my way into a job I’m pretty sure I can do, but can’t show that I can do.

	But enough about that. I’m currently working on some personal projects you can learn more about in the other tabs. I enjoy gaming; of both the table-top and computer varieties. I go to a few regular and semi-regular meetups around town; mostly talking philosophy. I try to stay in shape (or at least not too out of shape). Lift some weights, do some pushups, that kind of thing. I want to get back into parkour but places to do so are lacking here.
	Let’s see, what else. I’m introverted and a little awkward, but not unsociable. I tend to think objectively. If someone gives me a problem to solve, I’ll bang my head against it for as long as it takes to solve it. But I’m relatively bad at taking care of my own problems. They just seem… less important.

	I find it’s important for me to have a well ordered system to be able to work at my best, and I also need to understand the system, or at least how I relate to it. 

	As an example, I’ve written a bunch of scripts that run on my phone that set timers and notifications that get me to start tasks, tasks that I wouldn’t have started on my own, but in a way that allows me to control the system as a whole. It’s one of the things I love about scripting so much: that you can set up structures in exactly the way that works best for you.

	That kind of systematizing extends to how I think about things more generally too. I don’t tend to think in terms of discrete objects and steps, but in terms of systems and processes. When learning something new, I’ll try and get an intuitive understanding of how all of it works and how it’s pieces fit together.

	Sorry about that. I’m kinda all over the place. Very ‘stream of consciousness’. That is kinda the point though. This is an introduction; I’m trying to give you a sense of who I am and what I’m about. I feel that this kind of introduction gives a better understanding of who I am than a well-ordered, bulleted list ever could.

	That being said, it’s nice to meet you. Or at least, it’s nice to be met by you.

	-Ben Yakura
